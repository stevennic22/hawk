# Hawk - Slack mobile app review poster
> A script to check the Google Play Store and iOS App Store for new reviews for your app, and post them to Slack.

### Features

- Parse arguments and pull reviews for either Android or iOS
- Store app store last checked/which countries to run in json file
- Only post reviews since last check (skip countries if necessary)
- Translate non-english reviews
  - Some languages are currently not working properly (Chinese/Japanese). [#5](../../issues/5)
- Use test/debug slack credentials to test formatting elsewhere, without missing reviews and posts on a live slack
  - Example: `python review.pyw -ta` would search for Android reviews, post them to a test Slack and not update review.json for new stop values
